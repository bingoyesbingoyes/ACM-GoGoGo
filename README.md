# ACM-GoGoGo

**Welcome to the ACM-GoGoGo repository! This repo is dedicated to a WHU student's algorithm training and preparation for ACM competitions.**

# Contents

In this repo, you will find a daily record of my algorithm training, including my thoughts and reflections, summaries of what I've learned, and any code I've written. You will also find links to external resources that have helped me improve my skills.

# Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository and start exploring the contents. You can follow my journey from day to day, or jump straight to specific entries that interest you.

# Contributing

If you have any comments or suggestions, I'd love to hear them! You can contact me through the repository's issue tracker, and I'll do my best to respond to your feedback.

Thank you for visiting ACM-GoGoGo, and I hope my experiences can help you on your own journey towards becoming a top algorithmist!
